"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Doorstep Delivery","Dumbledore","I should have known that you would be here...Professor McGonagall."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Doorstep Delivery","McGonagall","Good evening, Professor Dumbledore. Are the rumours true, Albus?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Doorstep Delivery","Dumbledore","I'm afraid so, Professor. The good, and the bad."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Doorstep Delivery","McGonagall","And the boy?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Doorstep Delivery","Dumbledore","Hagrid is bringing him."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Doorstep Delivery","McGonagall","Do you think it wise to trust Hagrid with something as important as this?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Doorstep Delivery","Dumbledore","Ah, Professor, I would trust Hagrid with my life."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Doorstep Delivery","Hagrid","Professor Dumbledore, Sir. Professor McGonagall."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Doorstep Delivery","Dumbledore","No problems, I trust, Hagrid?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Doorstep Delivery","Hagrid","No, sir. Little tyke fell asleep just as we were flying over Bristol. Heh. Try not to wake him. There you go."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Doorstep Delivery","McGonagall","Albus, do you really think it's safe, leaving him with these people? I've watched them all day. They're the worst sort of Muggles imaginable. They really are..."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Doorstep Delivery","Dumbledore","The only family he has."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Doorstep Delivery","McGonagall","This boy will be famous. There won't be a child in our world who doesn't know his name."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Doorstep Delivery","Dumbledore","Exactly. He's better off growing up away from all that. Until he is ready."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Doorstep Delivery","Dumbledore","There, there, Hagrid. It's not really goodbye, after all."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Doorstep Delivery","Dumbledore","Good luck...Harry Potter."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Vanishing Glass","Petunia","Up. Get up.  Now!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Vanishing Glass","Dudley","Wake up, cousin! We're going to the zoo!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Vanishing Glass","Petunia","Oh, here he comes, the birthday boy!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Vanishing Glass","Vernon","Happy birthday, son."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Vanishing Glass","Petunia","Why don't you just cook the breakfast, and try not to burn anything."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Vanishing Glass","Harry","Yes, Aunt Petunia."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Vanishing Glass","Petunia","I want everything to be perfect for my Dudley's special day."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Vanishing Glass","Vernon","Hurry up! Bring my coffee, boy!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Vanishing Glass","Harry","Yes, Uncle Vernon."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Vanishing Glass","Petunia","Arenâ€™t they wonderful, darling?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Vanishing Glass","Dudley","How many are there?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Vanishing Glass","Vernon","Thirty-six. Counted 'em myself."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Vanishing Glass","Dudley","Thirty-six?! But last year last year I had thirty-seven!!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Vanishing Glass","Vernon","Err yes, well, some of them are quite a bit bigger than last year."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Vanishing Glass","Dudley","I don't care how big they are!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Vanishing Glass","Petunia","Oh, now, now, now. This is what we're going to do, is that when we go out, we're going to buy you two new presents! How's that, pumpkin?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Vanishing Glass","Petunia","This will be a lovely day at the zoo. I'm really looking forward to it."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Vanishing Glass","Vernon","I'm warning you now, boy. Any funny business, any at all, and you won't have any meals for a week. Get in."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Vanishing Glass","Dudley","Make it move."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Vanishing Glass","Vernon","Move!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Vanishing Glass","Dudley","MOVE!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Vanishing Glass","Harry","He's asleep!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Vanishing Glass","Dudley","He's boring."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Vanishing Glass","Harry","Sorry about him. He doesn't understand what it's like, lying there day after day, having people press their ugly faces in on you.  Can you...hear me?  It's just...I've never talked to a snake before. Do you...I mean...do you talk to people often?  You're from Burma, aren't you? Was it nice there, do you miss your family?  I see. That's me as well. I never knew my parents, either."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Vanishing Glass","Dudley","Mummy, dad, come here! You won't believe what this snake is doing!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Vanishing Glass","Dudley","Whoa! Ahh! Ahh!!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Vanishing Glass","Snake","Thanks."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Vanishing Glass","Harry","Anytime."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Vanishing Glass","Man","SNAKE!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Vanishing Glass","Dudley","Mum, mummy!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Vanishing Glass","Petunia","AHH!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Vanishing Glass","Dudley","Mum, help! Help me!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Vanishing Glass","Petunia","My darling boy! How did you get in there?! How did you get in there? Dursley, oh, Dursley!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Letters from No One","Petunia","It's all right. It's all right."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Letters from No One","Harry","Ow!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Letters from No One","Vernon","What happened?!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Letters from No One","Harry","I swear I don't know!  One minute, the glass was there and then it was gone! It was like magic!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Letters from No One","Vernon","There's no such thing as magic!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Letters from No One","Petunia","Awww, smile.  Vernon, just look at him. I can't believe it. In just a week you'll be off to Smeltings."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Letters from No One","Vernon","Caveat Smeltona. Proudest moment of my life."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Letters from No One","Harry","Will I have to wear that, too?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Letters from No One","Petunia","What, you? Go to Smeltings?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Letters from No One","Vernon","Ha!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Letters from No One","Petunia","Oh, don't be so stupid, you're going to the state school where you belong.  And this is what you're gonna be wearing when I've finished dyeing it."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Letters from No One","Harry","But that's Dudley's old uniform. It'll fit me like bits of old Elephant skin."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Letters from No One","Petunia","It'll fit you well enough. Go get the post.  Go!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Letters from No One","Vernon","Oh, Marge is ill! Ate a funny whelk."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Letters from No One","Dudley","Dad! Look! Harry's got a letter!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Letters from No One","Harry","Hey, give it back! It's mine!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Letters from No One","Vernon","Yours? Who'd be writing to you?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Letters from No One","Vernon","No more mail through this letterbox."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Letters from No One","Petunia","Have a lovely day at the office, dear."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Letters from No One","Vernon","Shoo! Go on!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Letters from No One","Vernon","Fine day Sunday. In my opinion, best day of the week. Why is that, Dudley?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Letters from No One","Harry","Because there's no post on Sunday?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Letters from No One","Vernon","Ah, right you are, Harry. No post on Sunday. Ha! No blasted letters today. No, sir. Not one single bloody letter, not one.  No, sir, not one blasted, miserable-"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Letters from No One","Dudley","AHH! Make it stop! Please make it stop!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Letters from No One","Vernon","Go away, ahh!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Letters from No One","Dudley","What is it? Please tell me what's happening!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Letters from No One","Vernon","Give me that! Give me that letter!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Letters from No One","Harry","Get off! Ahh!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Letters from No One","Vernon","Ahh!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Letters from No One","Harry","They're my letters! Let go of me!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Letters from No One","Vernon","That's it! We're going away! Far away! Where they can't find us!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Letters from No One","Dudley","Daddy's gone mad, hasn't he?!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Keeper of the Keys","Harry","Make a wish, Harry."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Keeper of the Keys","Vernon","Who's there? Ahh!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Keeper of the Keys","Hagrid","Sorry 'bout that."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Keeper of the Keys","Vernon","I demand that you leave at once, sir! You are breaking and entering!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Keeper of the Keys","Hagrid","Dry up, Dursley, you great prune.  Boy, I haven't seen you since you was a baby, Harry, but you're a bit more along than I would have expected. Particularly 'round the middle!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Keeper of the Keys","Dudley","I-I-I'm not Harry."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Keeper of the Keys","Harry","I-I am."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Keeper of the Keys","Hagrid","Oh, well, of course you are! Got something for ya. 'Fraid I might have sat on it at some point! I imagine that it'll taste fine just the same. Ahh. Baked it myself.  Words and all. Heh."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Keeper of the Keys","Harry","Thank you!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Keeper of the Keys","Hagrid","It's not every day that your young man turns eleven, now is it?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Keeper of the Keys","Harry","Excuse me, who are you?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Keeper of the Keys","Hagrid","Rubeus Hagrid. Keeper of keys and grounds at Hogwarts. Course, you'll know all about Hogwarts."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Keeper of the Keys","Harry","Sorry, no."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Keeper of the Keys","Hagrid","No? Blimey, Harry, didn't you ever wonder where your mum and dad learned it all?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Keeper of the Keys","Harry","Learned what?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Keeper of the Keys","Hagrid","You're a wizard, Harry."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Keeper of the Keys","Harry","I-I'm a what?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Keeper of the Keys","Hagrid","A wizard. And a thumping good one at that, I'd wager. Once you train up a little."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Keeper of the Keys","Harry","No, you've made a mistake. I can't be...a-a wizard. I mean, I'm just... Harry. Just Harry."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Keeper of the Keys","Hagrid","Well, just Harry. Did you ever make anything happen? Anything you couldn't explain when you were angry or scared?  Ah."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Keeper of the Keys","Harry","Dear, Mr. Potter. We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts' School of Witchcraft and Wizardry."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Keeper of the Keys","Vernon","He'll not be going! We swore when we took him in, weâ€™d put a stop to this rubbish!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Keeper of the Keys","Harry","You knew? You knew all along and you never told me?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Keeper of the Keys","Petunia","Of course we knew. How could you not be? My perfect sister being who she was. Oh, my mother and father were so proud the day she got her letter. We have a witch in the family. Isn't it wonderful? I was the only one to see her for what she was. A freak! And then she met that Potter, and then she had you, and I knew you'd be just the same, just as strange, just as ... abnormal. And then, if you please, she went and got herself blown up. And we got landed with you."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Keeper of the Keys","Harry","Blown up? You told me my parents died in a car crash!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Keeper of the Keys","Hagrid","A car crash? A car crash kill James and Lily Potter?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Keeper of the Keys","Petunia","We had to tell him something."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Keeper of the Keys","Hagrid","It's an outrage! It's a scandal!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Keeper of the Keys","Vernon","He'll not be going!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Keeper of the Keys","Hagrid","Oh, and I suppose a great Muggle like yourself's going to stop him, are you?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Keeper of the Keys","Harry","Muggle?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Keeper of the Keys","Hagrid","Non magic folk.  This boy's had his name down ever since he was born!  He's going to the finest school of witchcraft and wizardry in the world, and he'll be under the finest headmaster that Hogwarts has ever seen: Albus Dumbledore."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Keeper of the Keys","Vernon","I will not pay for some crackpot old fool to teach him magic tricks!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Keeper of the Keys","Hagrid","Never, insult Albus Dumbledore, in front of me."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Keeper of the Keys","Dudley","Ahh!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Keeper of the Keys","Hagrid","Oh, um, I'd appreciate if you didn't tell anyone at Hogwarts about that. Strictly speaking, I'm not allowed to do magic."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Keeper of the Keys","Harry","Okay."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Keeper of the Keys","Hagrid","Ooh, we're a bit behind schedule. Best be off.  Unless you'd rather stay, of course. Hmm?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Diagon Alley","Harry","First year students will require: three sets of work robes, one wand."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Diagon Alley","Hagrid","Essential bit of equipment, Harry."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Diagon Alley","Harry","One pair of dragon-hide gloves.  Hagrid, do they mean for a real dragon?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Diagon Alley","Hagrid","Well, they don't mean for a penguin, do they? Heh. Crikey, but not a dragon."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Diagon Alley","Harry","But you like a dragon?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Diagon Alley","Hagrid","Fast and misunderstood beasts, Harry. Fast and misunderstood."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Diagon Alley","Harry","All students must be equipped with...one standard size two pewter cauldron and may bring if they desire either an owl, a cat or a toad. Could we find all this in London?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Diagon Alley","Hagrid","If you know where to go."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Diagon Alley","Tom","Ah, Hagrid! The usual, I presume?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Diagon Alley","Hagrid","No thanks, Tom. I'm on official Hogwarts business today. Just helping young Harry here buy his school supplies."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Diagon Alley","Tom","Bless my soul. It's Harry Potter."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Diagon Alley","Man","Welcome back, Mr. Potter, welcome back."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Diagon Alley","Witch","Doris Crockford, Mr. Potter. I can't believe I'm meeting you at last."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Diagon Alley","Quirrell","Harry P-potter. C-can't tell you how pleased I am to meet you."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Diagon Alley","Hagrid","Hello, Professor. I didn't see you there. Harry, this is Professor Quirrell. He'll be your Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Diagon Alley","Harry","Oh, nice to meet you."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Diagon Alley","Quirrell","F-fearfully fascinating subject. N-not that you need it, e-eh, Potter? Heheh."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Diagon Alley","Hagrid","Yes, well, must be going now. Lots to buy. Heh."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Diagon Alley","Harry","Goodbye."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Diagon Alley","Hagrid","See, Harry, you're famous!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Diagon Alley","Harry","But why am I famous, Hagrid? All those people back there, how is it they know who I am?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Diagon Alley","Hagrid","I'm not exactly sure I'm the right person to tell you that, Harry.  Welcome, Harry, to Diagon Alley.  Here's where you'll get your quills and ink, and over there all your bits and bobs for doing your wizardry."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Diagon Alley","Boy","It's a world class racing broom. Look at it, itâ€™s the new Nimbus 2000! It's the fastest model yet."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Gringotts","Harry","But, Hagrid, how am I to pay for all this? I haven't any money."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Gringotts","Hagrid","Well, there's your money, Harry.  Gringotts, the Wizard Bank. T'aint no place safer, 'cept perhaps Hogwarts."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Gringotts","Harry","Uh, Hagrid, what exactly are these things?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Gringotts","Hagrid","They're goblins, Harry. Clever as they come goblins, but not the most friendly of beasts. Best stick close to me.  Mr. Harry Potter wishes to make a withdrawal."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Gringotts","Goblin","And does Mr. Harry Potter have his key?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Gringotts","Hagrid","Oh. Wait a minute. Got it here somewhere. Hah. There's the little devil.  Oh, and there's something else as well.  Professor Dumbledore gave me this.  It's about you-know-what in vault you-know-which."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Gringotts","Goblin","Very well."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Gringotts","Griphook","Vault 687. Lamp, please.  Key please."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Gringotts","Hagrid","Didn't think your mum and dad would leave you with nothing now, did ya?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Gringotts","Griphook","Vault 713."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Gringotts","Harry","What's in there, Hagrid?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Gringotts","Hagrid","Can't tell you, Harry. It's Hogwarts business. Very secret."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Gringotts","Griphook","Stand back."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Gringotts","Hagrid","Best not mention this to anyone, Harry."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Ollivanders","Harry","I still need...a wand."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Ollivanders","Hagrid","A wand? Well, you'll want Ollivanders.  No place better. Run along there, but wait. I just got one more thing I got to do. Won't be long."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Ollivanders","Harry","Hello? Hello?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Ollivanders","Ollivander","I wondered when I'd be seeing you, Mr. Potter. It seems only yesterday that your mother and father were in here buying their first wands.  Ah. Here we are.  Well, give it a wave.  Apparently not.  Perhaps this.  No, no, definitely not! No matter...  I wonder.  Curious, very curious."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Ollivanders","Harry","Sorry, but what's curious?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Ollivanders","Ollivander","I remember every wand I've ever sold, Mr. Potter. It just so happens that the phoenix, whose tail feather resides in your wand gave one other feather, just one. It is curious that you should be destined for this wand when its brother gave you that scar."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Ollivanders","Harry","And...who owned that wand?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Ollivanders","Ollivander","Oh, we do not speak his name. The wand chooses the wizard, Mr. Potter. It's not always clear why, but I think it is clear that we can expect great things from you. After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named did great things...terrible, yes, but great."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Ollivanders","Hagrid","Harry! Harry! Happy birthday!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Ollivanders","Harry","Wow."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Boy Who Lived","Hagrid","You all right, Harry? You seem very quiet."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Boy Who Lived","Harry","He killed my parents, didn't he? The one who gave me this. You know, Hagrid, I know you do."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Boy Who Lived","Hagrid","First, and understand this, Harry, 'cause it's very important. Not all wizards are good. Some of them go bad. A few years ago, there was one wizard who went as bad as you can go. And his name was V-...his name was V-..."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Boy Who Lived","Harry","Maybe if you wrote it down?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Boy Who Lived","Hagrid","No, I can't spell it. All right.  Voldemort."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Boy Who Lived","Harry","Voldemort?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Boy Who Lived","Hagrid","Shh!!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Boy Who Lived","Hagrid","It was dark times, Harry, dark times.  Voldemort started to gather some followers, brought 'em over to the dark side. Anyone that stood up to him ended up dead. Your parents fought against him, but nobody lived once he decided to kill 'em.  Nobody...not one. â€˜Cept you."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Boy Who Lived","Harry","Me? Voldemort tried to kill...me?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Boy Who Lived","Hagrid","Yes. That ain't no ordinary cut on your forehead, Harry. A mark like that only comes from being touched by a curse...and an evil curse at that."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Boy Who Lived","Harry","What happened to...to You-Know-Who?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Boy Who Lived","Hagrid","Well, some say he died. Codswallop in my opinion. Nope, I reckon he's out there, still, too tired to go on. But one thing's absolutely certain. Something about you stumped him that night. That's why you're famous. That's why everybody knows your name. You're the boy who lived."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Platform 9Â¾","Hagrid","What're you looking at?  Blimey, is that the time? Sorry, Harry, I'm gonna have to leave you. Dumbledore'll be wanting his- well, he'll be wanting to see me. Now, uh, your train leaves in 10 minutes. Here's your ticket.  Stick to it, Harry that's very important. Stick to your ticket."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Platform 9Â¾","Harry","Platform 9Â¾? But, Hagrid, there must be a mistake. This says Platform 9Â¾. There's no such thing...is there?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Platform 9Â¾","Man","Sorry."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Platform 9Â¾","Harry","Excuse me, excuse me."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Platform 9Â¾","Guard","Right on your left, ma'am."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Platform 9Â¾","Harry","Excuse me, sir. Can you tell me where I might find Platform 9Â¾?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Platform 9Â¾","Guard","9Â¾? Think you're being funny, do ya?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Platform 9Â¾","Mrs. Weasley","It's the same year after year. Always packed with Muggles, of course."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Platform 9Â¾","Harry","Muggles?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Platform 9Â¾","Mrs. Weasley","Come on. Platform 9Â¾ this way! All right, Percy, you first."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Platform 9Â¾","Mrs. Weasley","Fred, you next."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Platform 9Â¾","George","He's not Fred, I am!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Platform 9Â¾","Fred","Honestly, woman, you call yourself our mother."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Platform 9Â¾","Mrs. Weasley","Oh, I'm sorry, George."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Platform 9Â¾","Fred","I'm only joking. I am Fred."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Platform 9Â¾","Harry","Excuse me! C-could you tell me how to-"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Platform 9Â¾","Mrs. Weasley","How to get on the platform? Yes, not to worry, dear. It's Ron's first time to Hogwarts as well.  Now, all you've got to do is walk straight at the wall between platforms 9 and 10. Best do it at a bit of a run if you're nervous."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Platform 9Â¾","Ginny","Good luck."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Ron and Hermione","Ron","Excuse me, do you mind? Everywhere else is full."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Ron and Hermione","Harry","No, not at all."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Ron and Hermione","Ron","I'm Ron, by the way. Ron Weasley."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Ron and Hermione","Harry","I'm Harry. Harry Potter."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Ron and Hermione","Ron","So-so it's true? I mean, do you really have the...the..."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Ron and Hermione","Harry","The what?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Ron and Hermione","Ron","Scar...?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Ron and Hermione","Harry","Oh"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Ron and Hermione","Ron","Wicked."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Ron and Hermione","Woman","Anything off the trolley, dears?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Ron and Hermione","Ron","No, thanks, I'm all set."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Ron and Hermione","Harry","We'll take the lot!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Ron and Hermione","Ron","Whoa!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Ron and Hermione","Harry","Bertie Bott's Every Flavour Beans?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Ron and Hermione","Ron","They mean every flavour! There's chocolate and peppermint, and there's also spinach, liver and tripe. George sweared he got a bogey-flavoured one once!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Ron and Hermione","Harry","These aren't real chocolate frogs, are they?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Ron and Hermione","Ron","It's just a spell. Besides, it's the cards you want. Each pack's got a famous witch or wizard. I got about 500 meself.  Watch it!  Oh, that's rotten luck. They've only got one good jump in them to begin with."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Ron and Hermione","Harry","I got Dumbledore!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Ron and Hermione","Ron","I got about 6 of him."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Ron and Hermione","Harry","Hey, he's gone!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Ron and Hermione","Ron","Well, you can't expect him to hang around all day, can you?  This is Scabbers, by the way, pathetic, isn't he?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Ron and Hermione","Harry","A little."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Ron and Hermione","Ron","Fred gave me a spell as to turn him yellow. Want to see?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Ron and Hermione","Harry","Yeah!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Ron and Hermione","Ron","Ahem. Sun-"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Ron and Hermione","Hermione","Has anyone seen a toad? A boy named Neville's lost one."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Ron and Hermione","Ron","No."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Ron and Hermione","Hermione","Oh, are you doing magic? Let's see then."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Ron and Hermione","Ron","Sunshine, daises, butter mellow, turn this stupid fat rat yellow!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Ron and Hermione","Hermione","Are you sure that's a real spell? Well, it's not very good, is it? Of course I've only tried a few simple spells myself, and they've all worked for me. For example...  Oculus Reparo.  That's better, isn't it? Holy Cricket, you're Harry Potter. I'm Hermione Granger...and you are...?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Ron and Hermione","Ron","I'm...Ron Weasley."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Ron and Hermione","Hermione","Pleasure. You two better change into your robes. I expect we'll be arriving soon.  You've got dirt, on your nose, by the way, did you know? Just there."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Welcome to Hogwarts","Hagrid","Right, then! First years! This way, please! Come on, now, don't be shy! Come on now, hurry up!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Welcome to Hogwarts","Hagrid","Hello, Harry."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Welcome to Hogwarts","Harry","Hey, Hagrid."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Welcome to Hogwarts","Ron","Whoaa!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Welcome to Hogwarts","Hagrid","Right then. This way to the boats! Come on, now, follow me."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Welcome to Hogwarts","Ron","Wicked."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Welcome to Hogwarts","McGonagall","Welcome to Hogwarts. Now, in a few moments, you will pass through these doors and join your classmates. But before you can take your seats, you must be sorted into your houses. They are Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. Now while youâ€™re here, your house will be like your family. Your triumphs will earn you house points. Any rule breaking, and you will lose points. At the end of the year, the house with the most points is awarded the house cup."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Welcome to Hogwarts","Neville","Trevor!  Sorry."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Welcome to Hogwarts","McGonagall","The sorting ceremony will begin momentarily."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Welcome to Hogwarts","Draco","It's true then, what they're saying on the train. Harry Potter has come to Hogwarts.  This is Crabbe and Goyle. And I'm Malfoy...Draco Malfoy.  Think my name's funny, do you? No need to ask yours. Red hair, and a hand-me-down robe? You must be a Weasley. Well, soon find that some wizarding families are better than others, Potter. Donâ€™t want to go making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Welcome to Hogwarts","Harry","I think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself, thanks."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Welcome to Hogwarts","McGonagall","We're ready for you now. Follow me."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Sorting Hat","Hermione","It's not real, the ceiling. It's just bewitched to look like the night sky. I read about it in Hogwarts: A History."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Sorting Hat","McGonagall","Will you wait along here, please? Now, before we begin, Professor Dumbledore would like to say a few words."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Sorting Hat","Dumbledore","I have a few start of term notices I wish to announce. The first years please note that the dark forest is strictly forbidden to all students. Also, our caretaker, Mr. Filch  has asked me to remind you that the 3rd floor corridor on the right hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a most painful death. Thank you."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Sorting Hat","McGonagall","When I call your name, you will come forth, I shall place the sorting hat on your head, and you will be sorted into your houses. Hermione Granger."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Sorting Hat","Hermione","Oh, no. Okay, relax."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Sorting Hat","Ron","Mental that one, I'm telling you."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Sorting Hat","Sorting Hat","Ah, right then...hmm...right. Okay...Gryffindor!!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Sorting Hat","McGonagall","Draco Malfoy."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Sorting Hat","Sorting Hat","SLYTHERIN!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Sorting Hat","Ron","There isn't a witch or wizard who went bad who wasnâ€™t in Slytherin."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Sorting Hat","McGonagall","Susan Bones."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Sorting Hat","Harry","Ahh!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Sorting Hat","Ron","Harry, what is it?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Sorting Hat","Harry","Nothing... nothing, I'm fine."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Sorting Hat","Sorting Hat","Let's see...I know...Hufflepuff!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Sorting Hat","McGonagall","Ronald Weasley."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Sorting Hat","Sorting Hat","Ha! Another Weasley. I know just what to do with you... Gryffindor!!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Sorting Hat","McGonagall","Harry Potter."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Sorting Hat","Sorting Hat","Hmm...difficult, very difficult. Plenty of courage I see, not a bad mind, either. There's talent, oh yes, and a thirst to prove yourself. But where to put you?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Sorting Hat","Harry","Not Slytherin. Not Slytherin."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Sorting Hat","Sorting Hat","Not Slytherin, eh? Are you sure? You could be great, you know. Itâ€™s all here in your head. And Slytherin will help you on the way to greatness! There's no doubt about that. No?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Sorting Hat","Harry","Not Slytherin...anything but Slytherin."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Sorting Hat","Sorting Hat","Well, if you're sure... better be... GRYFFINDOR!!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Sorting Hat","Fred and George","We got Potter! We got Potter!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Nick and Other Residents","McGonagall","Your attention, please."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Nick and Other Residents","Dumbledore","Let the feast...begin."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Nick and Other Residents","Harry","Wow."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Nick and Other Residents","Seamus","I'm half and half. Me dad's a Muggle. Mam's a witch. Bit of a nasty shock for him when he found out."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Nick and Other Residents","Harry","Say, Percy, who's that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Nick and Other Residents","Percy","Oh, that's Professor Snape, head of Slytherin house."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Nick and Other Residents","Harry","What's he teach?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Nick and Other Residents","Percy","Potions. But everyone knows it's the Dark Arts he fancies. He's been after Quirrellâ€™s job for years."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Nick and Other Residents","Ron","Ahh!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Nick and Other Residents","Nick","Hello! How are you? Welcome to Gryffindor."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Nick and Other Residents","Bloody Baron","Whoo-hoo-hoo!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Nick and Other Residents","Girl","Look, itâ€™s the Bloody Baron!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Nick and Other Residents","Percy","Hello, Sir Nicholas. Have a nice summer?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Nick and Other Residents","Nick","Dismal. Once again, my request to join the headless hunt has been denied."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Nick and Other Residents","Ron","I know you! You're Nearly Headless Nick!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Nick and Other Residents","Nick","I prefer Sir Nicholas if you don't mind."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Nick and Other Residents","Hermione","Nearly headless? How can you be nearly headless?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Nick and Other Residents","Nick","Like this."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Nick and Other Residents","Ron","Ahh!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Nick and Other Residents","Percy","Gryffindors, follow me, please. Keep up. Thank you."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Nick and Other Residents","Boy","Ravenclaws, follow me. This way."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Nick and Other Residents","Percy","This is the most direct path to the dormitories. Oh, and keep an eye on the staircases...they like to change."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Nick and Other Residents","Percy","Keep up, please, and follow me. Quickly now, come on. Come on."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Nick and Other Residents","Neville","Seamus, that picture's moving!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Nick and Other Residents","Ron","Look at that one, Harry!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Nick and Other Residents","Harry","I think she fancies you."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Nick and Other Residents","Girl","Oh, look! Look! Who's that girl?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Nick and Other Residents","Man in a painting","Welcome to Hogwarts."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Nick and Other Residents","Girl","Who's that?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Nick and Other Residents","The Fat Lady","Password?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Nick and Other Residents","Percy","Caput Draconis.  Follow me, everyone. Keep up, quickly, come on."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Nick and Other Residents","Girl","Oh, wow."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Nick and Other Residents","Percy","Gather 'round here. Welcome to the Gryffindor Common Room. Boy's dormitories, upstairs and down to your left. Girls, the same on your right. You'll find that your belongings have already been brought up."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Potions and Parcels","Ron","Whew, we made it. Can you imagine the look on McGonagall's face if we were late?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Potions and Parcels","Ron","That was bloody brilliant."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Potions and Parcels","McGonagall","Thank you for that assessment, Mr. Weasley. Perhaps if I were to transfigure Mr. Potter and yourself into a pocketwatch, that way one of you might be on time."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Potions and Parcels","Harry","We got lost."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Potions and Parcels","McGonagall","Then perhaps a map? I trust you don't need one to find your seats."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Potions and Parcels","Snape","There will be no foolish wand waving or silly incantations in this class. As such, I don't expect many of you to appreciate the subtle science and exact art that is potion making. However, for those select few...  who possess the predisposition, I can teach you how to bewitch the mind and ensnare the senses. I can tell you how to bottle fame, brew glory and even put a stopper...  in death.  Then again, maybe some of you have come to Hogwarts in possession of abilities so formidable that you feel confidant enough to not...pay...attention.  Mr. Potter. Our...new...celebrity. Tell me, what would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?  You don't know? Well, let's try again. Where, Mr. Potter, would you look if I asked you to find me a bezoar?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Potions and Parcels","Harry","I don't know, sir."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Potions and Parcels","Snape","And what is the difference between monkshood and wolfbane?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Potions and Parcels","Harry","I don't know, sir."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Potions and Parcels","Snape","Pity. Clearly, fame isn't everything...  is it, Mr. Potter?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Potions and Parcels","Harry","Clearly, Hermione knows. Since it's a pity not to ask her."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Potions and Parcels","Snape","Silence.  And put her hand down, you silly girl.  For your information, Potter... asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful, it is known as the Draught of Living Death. A bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of a goat and it will save you from most poisons. As for monkshood and wolfsbane, they are the same plant, which also goes by the name of aconite.  Well?  Why aren't you all copying this down?  And Gryffindors, note that five points, will be taken from your house... for your classmate's cheek."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Potions and Parcels","Seamus","Eye of rabbit, harp string hum. Turn this water, into rum.  Eye of rabbit, harp string hum..."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Potions and Parcels","Harry","What's Seamus trying to do to that glass of water?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Potions and Parcels","Ron","Turn it into rum. Actually managed a weak tea yesterday, before-"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Potions and Parcels","Ron","Ah. Mail's here!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Potions and Parcels","Harry","Can I borrow this?  Thanks."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Potions and Parcels","Seamus","Hey, look! Neville's got a Remembrall!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Potions and Parcels","Hermione","I've read about those. When the smoke turns red,  it means you've forgotten something."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Potions and Parcels","Neville","The only problem is, I can't remember what I've forgotten."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Potions and Parcels","Harry","Hey, Ron, somebody broke into Gringotts, listen.  Believed to be the work of dark witches or wizards unknown, Gringotts goblins, while acknowledging the breach, insist that nothing was taken. The vault in question, number 713, had in fact been emptied earlier that same day. That's odd. That's the vault Hagrid and I went to."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Hooch","Good afternoon, class."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Class","Good afternoon, Madam Hooch."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Hooch","Good afternoon, Amanda, good afternoon.  Welcome to your first flying lesson. Well, what are you waiting for? Everyone step up to the left side of their broomstick. Come on now, hurry up. Stick your right hand over the broom and say, up!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Class","Up!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Harry","Wow."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Draco","Up!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Hooch","With feeling!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Hermione","Up. Up. Up. Up."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Ron","Up!!  Ooh!  Shut up, Harry."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Hooch","Now, once you've got hold of your broom, I want you to mount it. And grip it tight, you don't want to be sliding off the end.  When I blow my whistle, I want each of you to kick off from the ground, hard. Keep your broom steady, hover for a moment, and then lean forward slightly and touch back down. On my whistle...3...2..."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Neville","Oh..."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Hooch","Mr. Longbottom."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Girl","Neville, what are you doing?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Students","Neville...Neville..."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Boy","We're not supposed to take off, yet."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Hooch","M-M-Mr. Longbottom! Mr. Longbottom!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Neville","AHH!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Hooch","Mr. Longbottom!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Neville","Down! Down! Ahhhh!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Harry","Neville!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Neville","Help!!!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Hooch","Come back down this instant!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Neville","AHH!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Neville","Help!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Hooch","Mr. Longbottom-!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Neville","Ahhhh! Whoa! Ahhh!  Oh. Ah...help!  Ahh!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Hooch","Everyone out of the way!  Come on, get up."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Girl","Is he alright?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Neville","Owowowow."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Hooch","Oh, oh, oh, oh dear. It's a broken wrist. Tch, tch, tch. Good boy, come on now, up you get.  Everyone's to keep their feet firmly on the ground while I take Mr. Longbottom to the hospital wing. Understand? If I see a single broom in the air, the one riding it will find themselves out of Hogwarts before they can say, Quidditch."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Draco","Did you see his face? Maybe if the fat lump had given this a squeeze, he'd have remembered to fall on his fat arse."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Harry","Give it here, Malfoy."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Draco","No. I think I'll leave it somewhere for Longbottom to find.  How 'bout up on the roof?  What's the matter, Potter? Bit beyond your reach?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Hermione","Harry, no way! You heard what Madam Hooch said! Besides, you don't even know how to fly.  What an idiot."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Harry","Give it here, Malfoy, or I'll knock you off your broom!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Draco","Is that so?  Have it your way, then!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Boy","Good job, Harry!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Boy 2","Oh, that was wicked, Harry."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","McGonagall","Harry Potter?  Follow me."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Quirrell","An iguana s-such as this is..."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","McGonagall","You wait here."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Quirrell","... an essential in-gredient."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","McGonagall","Professor Quirrell, excuse me, excuse me. Could I borrow Wood for a moment, please?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Quirrell","Oh. Y-yes, of course.  And the vampire b-bat..."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","McGonagall","Potter, this is Oliver Wood. Wood, I have found you a Seeker!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Nick","Have you heard? Harry Potter's the new Gryffindor Seeker. I always knew he'd do well."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Ron","Seeker? But first years never make their house teams! You must be the youngest Quidditch player in..."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Harry","A century, according to McGonagall."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Fred","Hey, well done, Harry, Wood's just told us!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Ron","Fred and George are on the team, too. Beaters."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","George","Our job is to make sure that you don't get bloodied up too bad. Can't make any promises, of course. Rough game, Quidditch."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Fred","Brutal. But no one's died in years. Someone will vanish occasionally..."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","George","But they'll turn up in a month or two!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Ron","Oh, go on, Harry, Quidditch is great. Best game there is! And you'll be great, too!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Harry","But I've never even played Quidditch. What if I make a fool of myself?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Hermione","You won't make a fool of yourself. It's in your blood."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Ron","Whoa. Harry, you never told me your father was a Seeker, too."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Harry","I-I didn't know."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Three-Headed Sentinel","Ron","I'm telling you, it's spooky. She knows more about you than you do."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Three-Headed Sentinel","Harry","Who doesn't?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Three-Headed Sentinel","Ron","Ahh!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Three-Headed Sentinel","Harry","What's happening?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Three-Headed Sentinel","Hermione","The staircases change, remember?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Three-Headed Sentinel","Harry","Let's go this way."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Three-Headed Sentinel","Ron","Before the staircase moves again."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Three-Headed Sentinel","Harry","Does anyone feel like...we shouldn't be here?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Three-Headed Sentinel","Hermione","We're not supposed to be here. This is the 3rd floor. It's forbidden."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Three-Headed Sentinel","Harry","Let's go."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Three-Headed Sentinel","Ron","It's Filch's cat!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Three-Headed Sentinel","Harry","Run!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Three-Headed Sentinel","Harry","Quick! Letâ€™s hide though that door!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Three-Headed Sentinel","Harry","It's locked!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Three-Headed Sentinel","Ron","That's it, we're done for!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Three-Headed Sentinel","Hermione","Oh, move over!  Alohomora.  Get in."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Three-Headed Sentinel","Ron","Alohomora?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Three-Headed Sentinel","Hermione","Standard book of spells, Chapter 7."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Three-Headed Sentinel","Filch","Anyone here, my sweet?  Come on."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Three-Headed Sentinel","Hermione","Filch is gone."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Three-Headed Sentinel","Ron","Probably thinks this door's locked."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Three-Headed Sentinel","Hermione","It was locked."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Three-Headed Sentinel","Harry","And for good reason."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Three-Headed Sentinel","All","AHHHHHHH!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Three-Headed Sentinel","Ron","What do they think they're doing?? Keeping a thing like that locked up in a school."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Three-Headed Sentinel","Hermione","You don't use your eyes, do you? Didn't you see what it was standing on?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Three-Headed Sentinel","Ron","I wasn't looking at its feet! I was a bit preoccupied with its heads. Or maybe you didn't notice, there were three!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Three-Headed Sentinel","Hermione","It was standing on a trap door. Which means it wasn't there by accident. It's guarding something."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Three-Headed Sentinel","Harry","Guarding something?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Three-Headed Sentinel","Hermione","That's right. Now, if you two don't mind, I'm going to bed before either of you come up with another clever idea to get us killed... or worse, expelled!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Three-Headed Sentinel","Ron","She needs to sort out her priorities!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Facts and Feathers","Oliver","Quidditch is easy enough to understand. Each time has seven players, 3 chasers, 2 beaters, 1 keeper and a seeker. That's you. There are three kinds of balls.  This one's called the Quaffle. Now, the chasers handle the Quaffle and try to put it through one of those three hoops.  The keeper, that's me, defends the hoops.  With me so far?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Facts and Feathers","Harry","I think so. What are those?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Facts and Feathers","Oliver","You better take this.  Careful now, it's comin' back.  Eh, not bad, Potter, you'd make a fair beater... Uh-oh."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Facts and Feathers","Harry","What is that?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Facts and Feathers","Oliver","Bludger. Nasty little buggers. But you are the seeker, and the only thing I want you to worry about is this... the Golden Snitch."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Facts and Feathers","Harry","I like this ball."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Facts and Feathers","Oliver","Ah, you like it now. Just wait. It's wicked fast and damn near impossible to see."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Facts and Feathers","Harry","What do I do with it?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Facts and Feathers","Oliver","You catch it... before the other team's seeker. You catch this, the game is over. You catch this, Potter, and we win."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Facts and Feathers","Harry","Whoa."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Facts and Feathers","Flitwick","One of a wizard's most rudimentary skills is levitation the ability to make objects fly. Uh, do you all have your feathers?  Good. Now, uh, don't forget the nice wrist movement we've been practicing, hmm? The swish and flick. Everyone."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Facts and Feathers","All","The swish and flick."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Facts and Feathers","Flitwick","Good. And enunciate. Wingardium Leviosa. Off you go then."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Facts and Feathers","Draco","Wingardium Levio-saaa."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Facts and Feathers","Ron","Wingardrium Leviosar!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Facts and Feathers","Hermione","Stop, stop, stop. You're going to take someone's eye out. Besides, you're saying it wrong. It's Levi-o-sa, not Leviosar."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Facts and Feathers","Ron","You do it then if you're so clever. Go on, go on."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Facts and Feathers","Hermione","Wingardium Leviosa."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Facts and Feathers","Flitwick","Oh, well done! See here, everyone! Ms. Granger's done it! Oh, splendid!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Facts and Feathers","Seamus","Wingard Levosa."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Facts and Feathers","Flitwick","Well done, dear."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Facts and Feathers","Flitwick","Whooaaa! Ooh."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Facts and Feathers","Harry","I think we're going to need another feather over here, Professor."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Facts and Feathers","Ron","It's Levioooosa, not Leviosaaaar.  She's a nightmare, honestly. No wonder she hasn't got any friends!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Facts and Feathers","Harry","I think she heard you."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mountain Troll","Harry","Where's Hermione?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mountain Troll","Neville","Parvati Patil said that she wouldn't come out of the girl's bathroom. She said that she'd been in there all afternoon...crying."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mountain Troll","Quirrell","TROLL! IN THE DUNGEON! T-TROOLLL IN THE DUNGEON!!  Thought you ought to know."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mountain Troll","Dumbledore","SILLLLLEEENNNNCEEEEE!  Everyone will please, not panic. Now, Prefects will lead their houses back to the dormitories. Teachers will follow me to the dungeons."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mountain Troll","Girl","Hufflepuff, this way!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mountain Troll","Boy","Stay together!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mountain Troll","Percy","Gryffindors, keep up please. And stay alert!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mountain Troll","Harry","How could a troll get in?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mountain Troll","Ron","Not by itself. Trolls are really stupid. Probably people playing jokes.  What?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mountain Troll","Harry","Hermione! She doesn't know!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mountain Troll","Ron","I think the troll's left the dungeon!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mountain Troll","Harry","Itâ€™s going into the Girl's Bathroom!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mountain Troll","Harry","Hermione, move!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mountain Troll","Hermione","Help! Help!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mountain Troll","Ron","Hey, pea brain!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mountain Troll","Hermione","Ahhh! Help!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mountain Troll","Harry","Whooa! Whoa, whoa!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mountain Troll","Ron","Ew."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mountain Troll","Harry","Whoa, whoa whoa!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mountain Troll","Harry","Do something!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mountain Troll","Ron","What?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mountain Troll","Harry","Anything! Hurry up!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mountain Troll","Hermione","Swish and flick!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mountain Troll","Ron","Wingardium Leviosa!  Cool."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mountain Troll","Hermione","Is it...dead?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mountain Troll","Harry","I don't think so. Just knocked out.  Ew. Troll bogies."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mountain Troll","McGonagall","Oh! Oh, my goodness! E-Explain yourselves, both of you!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mountain Troll","Ron and Harry","Well, what it is..."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mountain Troll","Hermione","It's my fault, Professor McGonagall."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mountain Troll","McGonagall","Miss Granger?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mountain Troll","Hermione","I went looking for the troll. I'd read about them and thought I could handle it. But I was wrong. If Harry and Ron hadn't come and found me...I'd probably be dead."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mountain Troll","McGonagall","Be that as it may be...it was an extremely foolish thing to do.  I would have expected more rational behavior on your part, Miss Granger. Five points will be taken from Gryffindor for your serious lack of judgment.  As for you two gentlemen I just hope you realize how fortunate you are. Not many students could take on a fully grown mountain troll and live to tell the tale. Five points...will be awarded to each of you.  For sheer dumb luck."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mountain Troll","Quirrell","Perhaps you ought to go...M-might wake up...heh.  Ahh! Hehe...."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mountain Troll","Harry","Good for you to get us out of trouble like that."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mountain Troll","Ron","Mind you, I mean, we did save her life."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mountain Troll","Harry","Mind you, she didn't need saving if you hadn't insulted her."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mountain Troll","Ron","What are friends for?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Quidditch","Ron","Take a bit of toast, mate, go on."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Quidditch","Hermione","Ron's right, Harry. You're gonna need your strength today."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Quidditch","Harry","I'm not hungry."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Quidditch","Snape","Good luck today, Potter. Then again, now that you've proven yourself against a troll, a little game of Quidditch should be easy work for you...even if it is against Slytherin."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Quidditch","Harry","That explains the blood."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Quidditch","Hermione","Blood?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Quidditch","Harry","Listen, last night, I'm guessing Snape let the troll in as a diversion so he could try and get past that 3 headed dog. But, he got himself bitten, that's why he's limping."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Quidditch","Hermione","But why would anyone go near that dog?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Quidditch","Harry","The day I was at Gringotts, Hagrid took something out of one of the vaults. He said it was Hogwarts' business, very secret."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Quidditch","Hermione","So you're saying..."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Quidditch","Harry","That's what the dog's guarding. That's what Snape wants."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Quidditch","Hermione","Bit early for mail, isn't it?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Quidditch","Harry","But I-I never get mail."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Quidditch","Ron","Let's open it."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Quidditch","Harry","It's a broomstick!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Quidditch","Ron","Thats not just any broomstick, Harry.  It's a Nimbus 2000!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Quidditch","Harry","But who...?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Quidditch","Oliver","Scared, Harry?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Quidditch","Harry","A little."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Quidditch","Oliver","That's all right. I felt the same way before my first game."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Quidditch","Harry","What happened?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Quidditch","Oliver","Er, I don't really remember. I took a bludger to the head 2 minutes in. Woke up in the hospital a week later."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Quidditch","Lee","Hello, and welcome to Hogwarts' first Quidditch game of the season! Today's game Slytherin versus Gryffindor!!!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Quidditch","Neville","Gryffindor!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Quidditch","Lee","The players take their positions as Madam Hooch steps out onto the field to begin the game."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Quidditch","Hooch","Now, I want a nice clean game...from all of you."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Quidditch","Lee","The bludgers are up...followed by the Golden Snitch. Remember, the snitch is worth 150 points. The seeker who catches the Snitch ends the game."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Quidditch","Lee","The Quaffle is released...and the game begins!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Quidditch","Lee","Angelina Johnson scores! 10 points for Gryffindor!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Quidditch","Harry","Yes!  Whoa!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Quidditch","Hagrid","Well done!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Quidditch","Lee","Slytherin takes possession of the Quaffle. Bletchley passes to Captain Marcus Flint."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Quidditch","Ron and Seamus","Yay!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Quidditch","Harry","Yes!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Quidditch","Lee","Another 10 points to Gryffindor!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Quidditch","Gryffindors","Yay!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Quidditch","Flint","Give me that!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Quidditch","Flint","Take that side!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Interference Overcome","Harry","Whoa! Whooa!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Interference Overcome","Hagrid","What's going on with Harry's broomstick?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Interference Overcome","Hermione","It's Snape! He's jinxing the broom!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Interference Overcome","Ron","Jinxing the broom? What do we do?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Interference Overcome","Hermione","Leave it to me."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Interference Overcome","Ron","Come on, Hermione!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Interference Overcome","Hermione","Lacarnum Inflamarae."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Interference Overcome","Man","Fire! You're on fire!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Interference Overcome","Snape","What? Oh!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Interference Overcome","Ron","Go!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Interference Overcome","Hagrid","Go go go!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Interference Overcome","Hagrid","Looks like he's gonna be sick!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Interference Overcome","Lee","He's got the Snitch! Harry Potter receives 150 points for catching the Snitch!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Interference Overcome","Hooch","Gryffindor win!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Interference Overcome","Draco","No!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Interference Overcome","Hagrid","Yes!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Interference Overcome","Hermione","Whoo-hoo!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Interference Overcome","Crowd","Go go Gryffindor! Go go Gryffindor! Go go Gryffindor! Go go Gryffindor!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Hagrid","Nonsense! Why would Snape put a curse on Harryâ€™s broom?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Harry","Who knows? Why was he trying to get past that three-headed dog on Halloween?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Hagrid","Who told you â€˜bout Fluffy?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Ron","Fluffy?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Hermione","That thing has a name?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Hagrid","Well, of course he's got a name. He's mine. I bought him off an Irish feller I met down at the pub last year. Then I lent him to Dumbledore to guard the.."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Harry","Yes?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Hagrid","Shouldnâ€™t have said that. No more questions! Donâ€™t ask any more questions. That's top secret, that is."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Harry","But, Hagrid, whatever Fluffy's guarding, Snape's trying to steal it."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Hagrid","Codswallop. Professor Snape is a Hogwarts teacher."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Hermione","Hogwarts teacher or not, I know a spell when I see one. I've read all about them. You've got to keep eye contact and Snape wasn't blinking."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Harry","Exactly."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Hagrid","Now, you listen to me, all three of you. You're meddling in things that ought not to be meddled in. It's dangerous. What that dog is guarding is strictly between Dumbledore and Nicholas Flamel."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Harry","Nicholas Flamel?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Hagrid","I shouldn't said that. I should not have said that."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Harry","Nicholas Flamel.  Who's Nicholas Flamel?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Hermione","I don't know."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Ghosts","Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Ring the Hogwart bell. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas..."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Harry","Knight to E5."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Ron","Queen to E5."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Hermione","That's totally barbaric!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Ron","That's wizard's chess.  I see you've packed."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Hermione","See you haven't."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Ron","Change of plans, my parents decided to go to Romania to visit my brother Charlie. He's studying dragons there."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Hermione","Good, you can help Harry, then. He's going to go and look in the library for information on Nicholas Flamel."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Ron","We've looked a hundred times."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Hermione","Not in the restricted section. Happy Christmas."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Ron","I think we've had a bad influence on her."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Ron","Harry wake up! Come on Harry, wake up!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Ron","Happy Christmas, Harry."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Harry","Happy Christmas, Ron.  What are you wearing?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Ron","Oh. My mum made it.  It looks like you've got one too."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Harry","I-I've got presents?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Ron","Yeah!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Ron","There they are."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Harry","Your father left this in my possession before he died. It is time it was returned to you. Use it well."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Ron","What is it?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Harry","It's some kind of cloak."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Ron","Well, let's see then, put it on."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Ron","Whoa!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Harry","My body's gone!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Ron","I know what that is. That's an invisibility cloak."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Harry","I'm invisible?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Ron","They're really rare.  I wonder who gave it to you?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Harry","There was no name. It just said use it well."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Cloaked in darkness","Harry","Famous fire eaters...15th Century Fiends...Flamel...Nicholas Flamel...where are you?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Cloaked in darkness","Filch","Who's there?!  I know you're in there. You can't hide.  Who is it? Show yourself!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Cloaked in darkness","Quirrell","Severus...I-I thought..."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Cloaked in darkness","Snape","You don't want me as your enemy, Quirrell."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Cloaked in darkness","Quirrell","W-what do you m-mean?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Cloaked in darkness","Snape","You know perfectly well what I mean.  We'll have another chat soon...when you've had time to decide where your loyalties lie."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Cloaked in darkness","Filch","Oh, Professors. I found this, in the Restricted Section. It's still hot. That means there's a student out of bed."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Mirror of Erised","Harry","Mum?  Dad?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Mirror of Erised","Harry","Ron! You've really got to see this! Ron! You've got to see this!  Ron, Ron, come on. Get out of bed!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Mirror of Erised","Ron","Why?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Mirror of Erised","Harry","There's something you've got to see. Now, come on!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Mirror of Erised","Harry","Come on. Come. Come look, it's my parents!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Mirror of Erised","Ron","I only see me."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Mirror of Erised","Harry","Look in properly. Go on. Stand there. There. You see them, don't you? Thats my dad"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Mirror of Erised","Ron","That's me! Only, I'm head boy...and I'm holding the Quidditch cup! And bloody hell, I'm Quidditch Captain too! I look good. Harry, do you think this mirror shows the future?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Mirror of Erised","Harry","How can it? Both my parents are dead."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Mirror of Erised","George","Do you like yours, Ron?  Ron?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Mirror of Erised","Ron","I'll be right back.  Want to play chess?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Mirror of Erised","Harry","No."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Mirror of Erised","Ron","We go and visit Hagrid?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Mirror of Erised","Harry","No."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Mirror of Erised","Ron","Harry, I know what you're thinking, but don't. There's something not quite right about that mirror."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Mirror of Erised","Dumbledore","Back again, Harry?  I see that you, like so many before you, have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised. I trust by now you realize what it does. Let me give you a clue. The happiest man on earth would look into the mirror and see only himself, exactly as he is."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Mirror of Erised","Harry","So, then it shows us what we want? Whatever we want?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Mirror of Erised","Dumbledore","Yes...and no. It shows us nothing more or less than the deepest, most desperate desires of our hearts. Now you, who have never known your family, you see them standing beside you. But remember this, Harry. This mirror gives us neither knowledge or truth. Men have wasted away in front of it, even gone mad. That is why tomorrow it will be moved to a new home, and I must ask you not to go looking for it again. It does not do to dwell on dreams, Harry, and forget to live."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Harry","Hi, Hedwig."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Hermione","Look at you playing with your cards. Pathetic! We've got final exams coming up soon."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Ron","I'm ready! Ask me any question."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Hermione","All right, what are the three most crucial ingredients in a Forgetfulness Potion?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Ron","...I forgot."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Hermione","And what, may I ask, do you plan to do if this comes up in the final exam?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Ron","Copy off you?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Hermione","No, you won't! Besides, according to Professor McGonagall, we're to be given special quills bewitched with an anti-cheating spell."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Ron","That's insulting! It's as if they don't trust us!  Dumbledore again!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Ron","Leg-Locker Curse?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Harry","Malfoy."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Ron","You have got to start standing up to people, Neville."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Neville","How? I can barely stand at all!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Seamus","I'll do the counter-curse!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Neville Longbottom","No, that's all I need... you to set my bloody kneecaps on fire!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Seamus","I don't appreciate the insinuation, Longbottom. Besides, if anyone cares to notice, my eyebrows have completely grown back!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Harry","I found him!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Ron","'Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the Dark"" Wizard Grindelwald in 1945â€“'"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Harry","Go on."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Ron","'-for his discovery of the 12 uses of Dragon Blood, and his work on alchemy with his partner Nicolas Flamel!'"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Harry","I knew the name sounded familiar. I read it on the train that day."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Hermione","Follow me!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Neville Longbottom","Hey, wait, where are you going? What about the counter-curse?!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Hermione","I had you looking in the wrong section! How could I be so stupid? I checked this out a few weeks ago for a bit of light reading."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Ron","This is light?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Hermione","Of course! Here it is!  ""Nicholas Flamel is the only known maker of the Philosopher's Stone!"""
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Ron and Harry","The what?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Hermione","Honestly, don't you two read? ""The Philosopher's Stone is a legendary substance with astonishing powers. It will turn any metal into pure gold and produces the Elixir of Life, which will make the drinker immortal."""
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Ron","Immortal?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Hermione","It means you'll never die."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Ron","I know what it means!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Harry","Shh!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Hermione","""The only stone currently in existence belongs to Mr. Nicholas Flamel, the noted alchemist, who last year celebrated his 665th birthday!"" That's what Fluffy's guarding on the 3rd floor. That's what's under the trapdoor...the Philosopher's Stone!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Harry","Hagrid!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Hagrid","Oh, hello. Sorry, don't wish to be rude, but I'm in no fit state to entertain today."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","All three","We know about the Philosopher's Stone!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Hagrid","Oh."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Harry","We think Snape's trying to steal it."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Hagrid","Snape? Blimey, Harry, you're not still on about him, are you?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Harry","Hagrid, we know he's after the Stone. We just don't know why."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Hagrid","Snape is one of the teachers protecting the Stone! He's not about to steal it!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Harry","What?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Hagrid","You heard. Right. Come on, now, I'm a bit preoccupied today."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Harry","Wait a minute.  One of the teachers?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Hermione","Of course! There are other things defending the Stone, aren't there? Spells, enchantments."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Hagrid","That's right. Waste of bloody time, if you ask me.  Ain't no one gonna get past Fluffy. Hehe, not a soul knows how. Except for me and Dumbledore. I shouldn't have told you that. I shouldn't have told you that.  Oh!  Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Harry","Uh, Hagrid, what exactly is that?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Hagrid","That? It's a ... its um..."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Ron","I know what that is! But Hagrid, how did you get one?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Hagrid","I won it. Off a stranger I met down at a pub. Seemed quite glad to be rid off it, as a matter of fact."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Hermione","Is that...a dragon?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Ron","That's not just a dragon. That's a Norwegian Ridgeback! My brother Charlie works with these in Romania."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Hagrid","Isn't he beautiful? Oh. Bless him, look. He knows his mummy. Hehe. Hallo, Norbert."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Harry","Norbert?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Hagrid","Yeah, well, he's got to have a name, doesn't he?  Don't you, Norbert?  Dededede."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Hagrid","Ohh!  Oooh, ooh, ooh, well...he'll have to be trained up a bit, of course.  Who's that?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Harry","Malfoy."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Hagrid","Oh, dear."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Harry","Hagrid always wanted a dragon. He told me so the first time I met him."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Ron","It's crazy. And worse, Malfoy knows."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Harry","I don't understand. Is that bad?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Ron","It's bad."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","McGonagall","Good evening."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","McGonagall","Nothing, I repeat, nothing gives a student the right to walk about the school at night. Therefore, as punishment for your actions, 50 points will be taken."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Harry","50?!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","McGonagall","Each.  And to ensure it doesn't happen again, all four of you will receive detention."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Draco","Excuse me, Professor. Perhaps I heard you wrong. I thought you said...""the four of us."""
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","McGonagall","No, you heard me correctly, Mr. Malfoy. You see, as honorable as your intentions were, you too were out of bed after hours. You will serve detention with your classmates."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Forbidden Forest","Filch","A pity they let the old punishments die. There was a time detention would find you hanging by your thumbs in the dungeons. God, I miss the screaming.  You'll be serving detention with Hagrid tonight. He's got a little job to do inside the dark forest.  A sorry lot this, Hagrid. Oh, good God, man, you're not still on about that bloody dragon, are you?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Forbidden Forest","Hagrid","Norbert's gone. Dumbledore sent him off to Romania to live in a colony."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Forbidden Forest","Hermione","Well, that's good, isn't it? He'll be with his own kind."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Forbidden Forest","Hagrid","Yeah, but what if he don't like Romania? {Filch rolls eyes.} What if the other dragons are mean to him? He's only a baby, after all."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Forbidden Forest","Filch","Oh, for Gods sake, pull yourself together, man. You're going into the forest, after all. Got to have your wits about you."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Forbidden Forest","Draco","The forest? I thought that was a joke! We can't go in there. Students aren't allowed. And there are......werewolves!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Forbidden Forest","Filch","There's more than werewolves in those trees, lad. You can be sure of that.  Nighty-night."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Forbidden Forest","Hagrid","Right. Let's go."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Forbidden Forest","Harry","Hagrid, what's that?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Forbidden Forest","Hagrid","What we're here for. See that? That's unicorn's blood, that is. I found one dead a few weeks ago. Now, this one's been injured bad by something.  So, it's our job to find the poor beast. Ron, Hermione, you'll come with me."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Forbidden Forest","Ron","Okay."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Forbidden Forest","Hagrid","And Harry, you'll go with Malfoy."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Forbidden Forest","Draco","Okay. Then I get Fang!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Forbidden Forest","Hagrid","Fine. Just so you know, he's a bloody coward."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Forbidden Forest","Draco","You wait till my father hears about this. This is servant's stuff."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Forbidden Forest","Harry","If I didn't know better, Draco, I'd say you were scared."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Forbidden Forest","Draco","Scared, Potter?!  Did you hear that? Come on, Fang. Scared."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Forbidden Forest","Harry","What is it, Fang?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Forbidden Forest","Draco","HELP!!!!!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Forbidden Forest","Firenze","Harry Potter, you must leave. You are known to many creatures here. The forest is not safe at this time. Especially for you."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Forbidden Forest","Harry","But what was that thing you saved me from?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Forbidden Forest","Firenze","A monstrous creature. It is a terrible crime to slay a unicorn. Drinking the blood of a unicorn will keep you alive even if you are an inch from death. But at a terrible price. You have slain something so pure that the moment the blood touches your lips, you will have a half-life. A cursed life."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Forbidden Forest","Harry","But who would choose such a life?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Forbidden Forest","Firenze","Can you think of no one?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Forbidden Forest","Harry","Do you mean to say...that that thing that killed the unicorn...that was drinking its blood...that was Voldemort?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Forbidden Forest","Firenze","Do you know what is hidden in the school at this very moment?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Forbidden Forest","Harry","The Philosopher's Stone."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Forbidden Forest","Hermione","Harry!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Forbidden Forest","Hagrid","Hello there, Firenze. I see you've met our young Mr. Potter. You all right there, Harry?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Forbidden Forest","Firenze","Harry Potter, this is where I leave you. You're safe now. Good luck."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Up to Something","Hermione","You mean You-Know-Who's out there, right now, in the forest?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Up to Something","Harry","But he's weak. He's living off the unicorns. Don't you see? We had it wrong! Snape doesn't want the Stone for himself; he wants the Stone for Voldemort. With the Elixir of Life, Voldemort will be strong again. He'll... he'll come back."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Up to Something","Ron","But, if he comes back, you don't think he'll try to... kill you, do you?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Up to Something","Harry","I think if he'd had the chance, he might've tried to kill me tonight."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Up to Something","Ron","And to think I've been worrying about my Potions final."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Up to Something","Hermione","Hang on a minute.  We're forgetting one thing. Who's the one wizard Voldemort always feared? Dumbledore. As long as Dumbledore's around, Harry, you're safe. As long as Dumbledore's around, you can't be touched."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Man With Two Faces","Harry","You?  No. I-it canâ€™t be. Snape, h-he was the oneâ€”-"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Man With Two Faces","Quirrell","Yes. He does seem the type, doesnâ€™t he? Next to him, who would suspect p-p-p-poor st-stuttering Professor Quirrell?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Man With Two Faces","Harry","But-but that day, during the Quidditch match, Snape tried to kill me."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Man With Two Faces","Quirrell","No, dear boy. I tried to kill you.  And trust me, if Snapeâ€™s cloak hadnâ€™t caught fire and broken my eye contact, I would have succeeded, even with Snape muttering his little countercurse."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Man With Two Faces","Harry","Snape was trying to save me?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Man With Two Faces","Quirrell","I knew you were a danger to me right from the off. Especially after Halloween."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Man With Two Faces","Harry","Then-then you let the troll in."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Man With Two Faces","Quirrell","Very good, Potter, yes. Snape, unfortunately, wasnâ€™t fooled. While everyone else was running about the dungeon, he went to the third floor to head me off. He, of course, never trusted me again.  He rarely left me alone. But he doesnâ€™t understand. Iâ€™m never alone, never.  Now, what does this mirror do? I see what I desire. I see myself holding the stone. But how do I get it?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Man With Two Faces","Unseen Inhuman Voice","Use the boy."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Man With Two Faces","Quirrell","Come here, Potter. Now!  Tell me... what do you see?  What is it?  What do you see?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Man With Two Faces","Harry","I-Iâ€™m shaking hands with Dumbledore. Iâ€™ve won the House Cup."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Man With Two Faces","Unseen Inhuman Voice","He lies."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Man With Two Faces","Quirrell","Tell the truth! What do you see?!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Man With Two Faces","Unseen Inhuman Voice","Let me speak to him."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Man With Two Faces","Quirrell","Master, you are not strong enough."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Man With Two Faces","Unseen Inhuman Voice","I have strength enough for this."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Man With Two Faces","Voldemort","Harry Potter, we meet again."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Man With Two Faces","Harry","Voldemort."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Man With Two Faces","Voldemort","Yes. You see what Iâ€™ve become? See what I must do to survive? Live off another, a mere parasite. Unicorn blood can sustain me, but it cannot give me a body of my own. But there is something that can, something that, conveniently enough, lies in your pocket."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Magic Touch","Voldemort","Stop him.  Don't be a fool! Why suffer a horrific death when you can join me and live?!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Magic Touch","Harry","Never!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Magic Touch","Voldemort","Haha. Bravery. Your parents had it too. Tell me, Harry, would you like to see your mother and father again? Together, we can bring them back.  All I ask for is something in return.  That's it, Harry. There is no good and evil. There is only power, and those too weak to seek it. Together, we'll do extraordinary things. Just give me the stone!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Magic Touch","Harry","You liar!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Magic Touch","Voldemort","Kill him!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Magic Touch","Quirrell","Ahh! Ahh!  What is this magic?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Magic Touch","Voldemort","Fool! Get the stone!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mark of Love","Dumbledore","Good afternoon, Harry. Ah. Tokens from your admirers?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mark of Love","Harry","Admirers?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mark of Love","Dumbledore","What happened down in the dungeons between you and Professor Quirrell is a complete secret, so, naturally, the whole school knows.  Ah, I see your friend Ronald has saved you the trouble of opening your Chocolate Frogs."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mark of Love","Harry","Ron was here? Is he all right? What about Hermione?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mark of Love","Dumbledore","Fine. They're both just fine."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mark of Love","Harry","But, what happened to the Stone?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mark of Love","Dumbledore","Relax, dear boy. The stone has been destroyed. My friend Nicholas and I had a little chat and agreed it was best all around."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mark of Love","Harry","But Flamel, he'll die, won't he?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mark of Love","Dumbledore","He has enough Elixir to set his affairs in order. But yes, he will die."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mark of Love","Harry","How is it I got the Stone, sir? One minute I was staring in the mirror, and the next..."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mark of Love","Dumbledore","Ah. You see, only a person who wanted to find the Stone, find it, but not use it, would be able to get it. That is one of my more brilliant ideas. And between you and me that's saying something."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mark of Love","Harry","Does that mean, with the Stone gone, I mean, that Voldemort can never come back?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mark of Love","Dumbledore","Ah, I'm afraid there are ways in which he can return. Harry, do you know why Professor Quirrell couldn't bear to have you touch him?  It was because of your mother. She sacrificed herself for you, and that kind of act leaves a mark.  No, no, this kind of mark cannot be seen. It lives in your very skin."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mark of Love","Harry","What is it?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mark of Love","Dumbledore","Love, Harry, love.  Ah. Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans. I was most unfortunate in my youth to come across a vomit flavored one, and since then I have lost my liking for them. But I think I could be safe with a nice toffee... Mm. Alas. Earwax."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mark of Love","Harry","All right there, Ron?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mark of Love","Ron","All right? You?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mark of Love","Harry","All right. Hermione?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mark of Love","Hermione","Never better."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","House Cup Winner","Dumbledore","Another year, gone! And now, as I understand it, the house cup needs awarded and the points stand thus. In fourth place: Gryffindor, with 312 points!  In third place: Hufflepuff, with 352 points!  Second: Ravenclaw, with 426 points!  And in first place, with 472 points: Slytherin house!  Yes, well done Slytherin, well done Slytherin. However, recent events must be taken into account and I have a few last minute points to award.  First, to Miss Hermione Granger, for the cool use of intellect while others were in grave peril: fifty points!  Second, to Mr Ronald Weasley, for the best played game of chess that Hogwarts has seen these many years: fifty points!  And third, to mister Harry Potter, for pure love and outstanding courage, I award Gryffindor house: sixty points!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","House Cup Winner","Hermione","We're tied with Slytherin!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","House Cup Winner","Dumbledore","And finally: it takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to your enemies, but a great deal more to stand up to your friends. I award ten points to Neville Longbottom!  Assuming that my calculations are correct, I believe that a change of decoration is in order!  Gryffindor wins the House Cup!"
